# Guitar  Pedals

A collection of DIY guitar pedal projects I've done/am
doing. 

Most projects start with buying a bare PCB for a 
given effect, sourcing the required components and parts (resistors, pots, enclosure, etc), soldering them together, and then testing and troubleshooting.

Although I primarily do these projects for fun, I learn 
a ton while doing them. This includes experience with 
multimeters, soldering, audioprobes, technical documentation and datasheets, handling IC's and other static-sensitive parts, and diagnostics/troubleshooting.
