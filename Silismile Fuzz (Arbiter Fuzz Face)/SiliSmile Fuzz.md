# SiliSmile (Fuzz Face)

The [PedalPCB SiliSmile](https://www.pedalpcb.com/product/pcb582/) 
is a clone of the historic [Arbiter Fuzz Face](https://fuzzboxes.org/fuzzface), 
an early fuzz/distortion pedal used by many influential musicians, perhaps most 
famously Jimi Hendrix.

I bought this PCB as part of a [great build kit from StompBoxParts](https://stompboxparts.com/kits/fuzz-face-diy-pedal-kit/). The kit included all the 
necessary parts and materials, including all the passive components, knobs, wire, 
enclosure, etc.

Basically, I wanted an easy and stress-free build, and this kit delivered. The 
entire build was done in one day in August 2023 and pretty much worked first try, which is not terribly surprising given build simplicity.

## Resources

As mentioned before, I bought [StompBoxPart's Fuzz Face DIY kit](https://stompboxparts.com/kits/fuzz-face-diy-pedal-kit/) to make my life easy. They also
produced a fantastic [build demo/tutorial video](https://youtu.be/TpoT_kZp9jg)
so there was no confusion on the process.
